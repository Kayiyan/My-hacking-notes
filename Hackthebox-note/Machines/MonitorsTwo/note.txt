---> it seems port 80 is open -> let see.

it seem use cacti -version 1.2.22 -> try search this version on exploit db might get some vuln about this .


get this payload to remote the host from this : https://github.com/ariyaadinatha/cacti-cve-2022-46169-exploit/

we can try remote the web and connect shell to that.

succesfully.

move to /home directory the file entrypoint might have some cool infomation..

read that file we have the command to dump the database -> /bin/bash -p and run that command , find more interesting info in the user_auth.

$2y$10$vcrYth5YcCLlZaPDj6PwqOYTw68W1.3WeKlBn70JonsdW/MhFYK4C(marcus) -> look like we need crack this .

--> funkymonkey -> connect the host with ssh .

-> got user flag : 1b493b5f86b59febfe3c701e478ac03c


run the file ./linpeas.sh to see what file we can write on it -> see file bash at /bin/bash -> chmod 4777 on that file and the execute permision on that -> run this file and we can get the root user -> root flag : eb593ed844e3880062afa1d6a7fd2974
